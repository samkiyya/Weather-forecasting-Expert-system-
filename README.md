# Weather Forecasting Expert System

Welcome to the Weather Forecasting Expert System! This project utilizes an expert system to predict weather conditions based on user input. It provides weather forecasts based on various parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

## Description

The Weather Forecasting Expert System is built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. It incorporates categorical and numerical conditions to match user input with predefined rules and provide accurate weather forecasts.
